## Introduction

In this enchanting repository, we explore the magic of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). From the quirky inheritance tree to the polymorphic creatures, every line of code tells a tale of abstraction, encapsulation, and code elegance.

## Features

1. **Class:**
   - Witness a parade of classes showcasing their unique attributes and behaviors.
   - Explore the inheritance hierarchy ‚Äì a family reunion like no other!

2. **Polymorphic :**
   - Marvel at the flexibility of polymorphism, where functions take on different forms.
   - Watch as the same method name transforms into various magical incantations.

3. **Abstraction :**
   - Behold the beauty of abstraction as we hide complexity behind elegant interfaces.
   - Experience the joy of encapsulation ‚Äì where implementation details are tucked away.

## Important OOP Concepts

### 1. Classes and Objects

In the heart of OOP lies the concept of classes and objects. A class is a blueprint, a design, a template for creating objects. Objects, on the other hand, are instances of classes, each with its own state and behavior.
### 2.  Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit attributes and behaviors from another class (superclass/base class). It promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.
### 3. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. It enables a single interface to represent different types or forms.
### 4. Abstraction
Abstraction involves hiding the complex reality while exposing only the essential parts. Abstract classes and interfaces provide a blueprint for other classes but cannot be instantiated themselves.

### 5. Encapsulation
Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It protects the integrity of the data and prevents unintended external access.

### 6. Composition
Composition involves creating relationships between classes by embedding one object within another. It allows for a more flexible and modular design.

### 7. Interface
An interface defines a contract for a class, specifying a set of methods that the class must implement. It allows for a common way to interact with objects of different classes.
 In C++, interfaces are achieved using abstract classes with pure virtual functions.

###  8. Abstract Classes
Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods. They provide a common base class for other classes.

### 9. Method Overloading
Method overriding occurs when a derived class provides a specific implementation for a function that is already defined in its base class.

### 10. Method Overriding
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. It allows for customization of behavior.
### 11. Constructors
Constructors are special methods that are automatically called when an object is created. They are used to initialize the object's attributes.

### 12. Destructors
Destructors are special member functions that are called when an object goes out of scope. They are used to perform cleanup tasks.

### 13. Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
